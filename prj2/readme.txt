For this project, I use NS3 to simulate TCP and UDP traffic over a WiFi network. To visualize the network, I used NetAnim. 
After simulating the two types of traffic, I used the simulation outputs to analyze the average and peak throughput for each connection. Every simulation ran differed in RTT, RWND, and MCS as to test what would impact throughput the most.
